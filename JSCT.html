                <h1 class="post-title">Notes for the Team Coach</h1>
                <p class="post-meta">Posted 4 July 2018</p>
            </header>
            
            <p>Knowledge of chess is not essential for the Coach!</p>
            
            <p>A team numbers four players.&nbsp;All players should have a sound grasp of the rules of the game.&nbsp;A fifth player can be used as a reserve.</p>
            <p>
                Players should be ranked by approximate playing strength, from number 1 (strongest) down to number 4 (weakest).&nbsp;
                Players are usually able to accurately rank themselves.&nbsp;Choose a team captain (usually the strongest player).&nbsp;
                If you have extra players, consider fielding an additional team but ensure your teams attend different qualifying rounds if possible so they don't eliminate one another.
            </p>
            <p>Get the team to think up a name!&nbsp;It is helpful if your school appears in the team name (e.g. Waikuku Wolves, North Loburn Knights, etc).</p>
            <p>
                Encourage the team to get in some practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The more practice the better!&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Why not arrange a mini-tournament with neighbouring schools so that players get to experience a competitive environment?
            </p>
            <p>
                The Coach will need to get the team to the venue ready for a 9:30am start.&nbsp;
                The Coach should remain with the team while the games are played.</p>
<p>
                The tournament should be completed by 3:30pm.&nbsp;
            </p>
<p>The Coach should ensure that each player has their lunch with them.</p>
            <p>North Canterbury Chess will provide all the equipment for the competition.&nbsp;School uniforms are at the discretion of the school.</p>
            
            <p>
